## Introduction 

This project documentation is related to the group project assignment of the course 7,789| 8,789: Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages taught by Dr. Mario Silic. This project at the University of St. Gallen was conducted by Valentin Back (_CodingXCamp User: TBD_), Michael Schnidrig (_MichaelX_), Christina Cappelli (_chrima_) and Fabio Bianchetti (_Coder_XYX_).

## Project Description

With the raise of audio streaming services such as Spotify, users changed their music consumption habits radically. The new music streaming services allow one to listen to millions of songs without possessing hard copies of them and provide the user with huge flexibilty towards when, how and what to listen to. The swedish based company moreover operates a Developer Platform, where user can develop the platform over Spotify APIs and SDKs for JavaScript, iOS, and Android. With the increased functionality of the streaming service, end user benefit from improvements on a continuous basis and make their music listening experience unique. With this opportunity set at hand, this project wants to demonstrate how such a streaming service improvement for end user can be designed and implemented.

With over 82 million songs on the platform user can get quite overwhelmed when they try to find a song or create a playlist. Here, Spotify already has running algorythms where user get suggestions based on their previous listening behaviour. With our playlist generator we want to contribute to this functionalities and give the user the opportunity to create and customize a randomized playlist with a simple program written in the program language python. The objective is to fill Spotify-playlists automatically and to ask the user for initial inputs to customize his playlist towards the number of songs, the release year or multi-year periods. 

## Tutorial

To run the playlist generator the user needs to have an active spotify subscription and complete the outlined steps in this tutorial which are presented in the following sections:

      ii. Delete the URL part until and including "/"
      iii. Paste only the Playlist ID behind

### Running the program in python

8. Download the project folder "Playlist Generator" containing the files 10k non-hits and requirements 
9. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code, PyCharm CE or a similar program
10. Install requirements.txt
11. Add the key variables which where extracted from the developer project website and the newly generated playlist (previous two sections in the tutorial)
12. 







bear in mind that users may not be familiar with coding language and hold the process as intuitivily as possible
